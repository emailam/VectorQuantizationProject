# Vector Quantization Project
Image Compressor and Decompressor using Vector Quantization in Java
# Description
This project is an image compressor and decompressor using the Vector Quantization algorithm, implemented in Java. It includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use. The program allows users to compress images and decompress them using the same algorithm.
# Features
- Compress images using the Vector Quantization algorithm
- Decompress images using the Vector Quantization algorithm
- User-friendly GUI for easy interaction
# Usage
To use this project, clone the repository and compile the Java files using a Java compiler. Run the application to access the GUI, where you can select images for compression and decompression.
